This repository contains a Python application for age and gender detection utilizing the OpenCV library and pre-trained models. With this powerful tool, you can analyze faces in images and estimate the age and gender of the individuals.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following files available in your project directory:

opencv_face_detector.pbtxt: The prototxt file for the OpenCV face detection model.
opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb: The pre-trained face detection model.
age_deploy.prototxt: The prototxt file for the age prediction model.
age_net.caffemodel: The pre-trained age prediction model.
gender_deploy.prototxt: The prototxt file for the gender prediction model.
gender_net.caffemodel: The pre-trained gender prediction model.
To install these files in your directory I've loaded the all file you can download from my REPOSITORY
